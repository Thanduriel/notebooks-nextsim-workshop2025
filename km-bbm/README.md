## Kilometer-scale sea-ice-ocean coupled simulations with a brittle rheology
Stephanie Leroux (Datlas, Grenoble), Pierre Rampal (IGE/CNRS, Grenoble), Laurent Brodeau (IGE/CNRS, Grenoble)

In this session we will look at sea-ice-ocean  simulations with the SI3-NEMO model at 1/12째 and 1/36째 horizontal  resolution  produced by Laurent Brodeau and Pierre Rampal at IGE Grenoble. The Elasto-Brittle rheology (BBM) is implemented in this eulerian model (Brodeau et al [2024 https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-6051-2024](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-6051-2024)) based on a staggered grid (E grid). It  provides us a framework to test the BBM rheology at high-reslution (kilometric scale) resolution and with ocean coupling.

In this session, we will primarily look at some videos of those simulations produced at 1/36째 (1 km) and 1/12째 (4 km) with BBM rheology as well as with the standard aEVP rheology available in this model. Workshop participants will also have access to the model outputs so that they can  look at more specific diagnostics of their own during the following hackathon.

The videos are available in the [YouTube playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvzG0ke9xnX6fLPuoiMdLpQa0SM7Mvujb](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvzG0ke9xnX6fLPuoiMdLpQa0SM7Mvujb). Some videos are already uploaded. Some more will be uploaded by the day of the workshop.

The model outputs will be available as netcdf files in this directory by the day of the workshop:
