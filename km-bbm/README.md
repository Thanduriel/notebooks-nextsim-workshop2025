## Kilometer-scale sea-ice-ocean coupled simulations with a brittle rheology
Stephanie Leroux (Datlas, Grenoble), Pierre Rampal (IGE/CNRS, Grenoble), Laurent Brodeau (IGE/CNRS, Grenoble)

#### Workshop session teaser:
In this session of the workshop we will look at sea-ice-ocean  simulations with the SI3-NEMO model at 1/12° (4 km) and 1/36° (1 km) horizontal  resolution  produced by Laurent Brodeau and Pierre Rampal at IGE Grenoble. The Elasto-Brittle rheology (BBM) is implemented in the SI3 sea ice model (Brodeau et al [2024 https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-6051-2024](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-6051-2024)) in the Eulerian framework, based on a staggered grid (E grid). In the  SASIP project, it  provides us a framework to test the BBM rheology at high-reslution (kilometric scale) resolution and with ocean coupling.

In this session, we will primarily look at some videos of those simulations produced at 1/36° (1 km) and 1/12° (4 km) with BBM rheology as well as with the standard aEVP rheology available in this model. 

Workshop participants will also have access to the model outputs at 1/12° resolution so that they can  look at more specific diagnostics of their own during the following hackathon session.

#### Videos:
The videos that we will discuss in this session are available in this [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvzG0ke9xnX6fLPuoiMdLpQa0SM7Mvujb). Only one video has been  uploaded so far but some more will be uploaded before the workshop.

#### Model outputs:
Model outputs will be available as netcdf files with this likn by the day of the workshop: https://ige-meom-opendap.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/thredds/catalog/meomopendap/extract/SASIP/extra-data-nextsim-workshop2025/hires-BBM/catalog.html
